Turning seminar 7 game ino object-oriented representation

1.Let's turn tthe board module functions into the Board class
    How can we protect class attributes from outside changes ?

    protecting class attributes from outside change :
    C#, Java, Kotlin, C++ -> public, private, protected
        -public -> anyone can access and change
        -private -> only class functions can access and change
        -protected -> only class functions and derived classes can access and change
    (default)

    Python
    <var.name> -> public
    _<var.name> -> private
    __<var.name> -> protected
